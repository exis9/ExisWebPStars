This is an app that can convert the file format of and resize a large number of images at the same time.
You can also select the scaling algorithm, cropping method, compression rate, and image quality.

It supports most major image formats, including **JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and AVIF**. All of them can be converted between each other.
There is also a function that allows you to add sequential numbers and dates to the name when saving.

What's more, you can even specify a background color and make it transparent for all files!

# Security Warning?
For Windows users, since it is not a registered on the Microsoft Store, a security warning will appear only the first time you launch it, but there is no risk, so if the warning appears, just click "More Info" and launch it.


## Mac is unfair for freeware developpers!
Since I don't pay $99 to Apple every year, Mac won't allow you to launch this app without applying a unnecessary security permission.
If you get a security warning and can't launch this app, follow the simple steps as follow:

After installation, just launch the app. If you have a security warning and can't launch it, do this:

```
1. Go to Settings and click "Privacy & Security"
2. Click "Open Anyway"
```
